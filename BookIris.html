    <h1>Iris</h1>
    <p>Prologue <br>
        It seemed as if silence fell on the land that was at war as the child let out her first cry. “waaaa…”, burst out of her tiny lungs. The people fighting to protect the child looked in the direction of the cry, rejoicing that the child was born. While the enemy began their assault again. Blood littered the ground all around them. Their peoples bodies littered the ground, they would not be able to keep up for to much longer as the clan had already been brought down to 25% of what they once were. <br><br>
        Knowing that her people could not keep tis up for much longer she stood from the bed that she just bore a child on. Holding her child in her arms she says, “My dear Iris…” as she locks her child’s power away and hands her off to her father. He grabs her hand saying “you cant fight like this, I will go.” <br><br>
        “No, I will only be a burden as I am now you must protect our child for both you and me.” Tears stream down her sweaty face as she kisses him and Iris for the last time not wanting to let go. Turning to walk away he grabs her arm in a grip unbefitting of his size. His slim arm held on to her with an iron grip. The look in her eyes makes him loosen his grip and she rips her arm away taking off in the direction of her sister.<br><br>
         
        Chapter 1 <br>
        Today is the day. The day most people are looking forward to, has come for me but I wish it would just go away. All I want to do is sit in my room reading anime about people with amazing powers, defeating stronger opponent. People that I could never be. Today is the Awakening day, it’s the day where they force your powers out completely. Most people that are strong began using their power as a child like my best friend Eva who used Light magic at the shocking age of 8 years old. She revived a dead rabbit who we used to feed on the way to school. Me, I’ve done nothing as great, to be exact I have done nothing at all. <br><br>
        “You don’t have to look so down even if you fail at awakening your power I will hire you to be my house maid,” coming up next to me as I headed to my doom Eva says smiling ear to ear as if what she said was funny. Which must have been true because I begin to laugh at her corny joke that she has been telling me for years. Rapping my arms around her as if to give her a hug but I decide a choke hold is better for this occasion. <br><br>
        “Oh, you are freaking hilarious.” I say tightening my hold until she pleads mercy for her wrong doings. <br><br>
        “Are you trying to kill me?”<br><br>
        “Yes, No, Maybe?” I ask in the form of a question.  This has been our day to day activities for about a month now. “Hell, hath finally cometh for thy. Dark days is in thy future. Shalt we runneth away” I cry in all honesty knowing I could never get away with it for my father is coming to school today to get pictures of me after I awaken my gifts. <br><br>
        “Ms. Iris I hope that you wont use my teaching of Shakespearean writing to get out of attending your awakening ceremony,” oh no I think. Turning to face the person of my fears before me stood Mrs. Dale. She is the most feared teacher in the school because her teaching style is unorthodox. If one disregards an assignment given by her or doesn’t learn at the speed she believes on should learn at she kicks them out of her class no matter what time of the year. Only one student has ever gotten a 97 in her class, that was 25 years ago when she first started teaching and that person grew to be the king. <br><br>
