    <h1>The Crazy Unbelievable Truth</h1>
    <p>
        I haven’t been home for 10 years. My parents through me out of the house after I got hurt one summer. When I was a kid I was attacked by an animal I almost died. I was slashed across my hip there is still a claw mark scar on my hip. But we will get to that part of the story later.<br><br>
        Walking out of the airport the first thing I see is a giant probably over 6 foot 5 in starring off in the distance. He was wearing a lame t shirt that had a giant bear on the front and read bear be with you, some slacks and a pair of snickers. My first thought was to avoid this weirdo at all cost. I turn to avoid him and run straight into someone’s chest. “sorry”, I say quickly because right in front of me stood another beast of a man. Grabbing my things to leave I turn yet again Only to come face to face with the giant weirdo from earlier. Well let’s be honest face to face is over exaggerating, it was more like face to neck, maybe even chest. <br><br>
        I try to look for a way out just as the weirdo ask, “Hey, shorty, you Zander?” They must have the wrong person, I think even though my name is in fact Zander. They must be looking for a different person with my name. Looking around I realize its just me and them in this airport. Well no one would come to this backwoods place. There is nothing but rolling hills as far as the eye can see. On the way here, there was a sign that read Welcome to Snow-Valley Population 350 adding me 351 people. Realizing that they must be looking for me. looking down at my luggage I come up with two chooses. I could run away from here or I could trust The giant and the weirdo. Well with their arm length I wouldn’t make it far if I tried to run, unwillingly I finally say, “Yeah, I’m Zander.”<br><br>
        “Zander, what’s up we haven’t seen you in 10 years. You don’t sound to happy to see your brother baby brother,” the tall stranger I bumped into says.<br><br>
        Brother, my brother was 4 years younger than me and just a cry baby, who couldn’t handle my left hook. This Hulk is not the cute and energetic little brother I remember. Take to note I mentioned small as in smaller than me. This is really making me doubt my masculinity and I stand at 5’9”. “No way I will not believe it.” My cute small little brother became a beast in the 10 years I was gone. <br><br>
        “Well id be ashamed too, my 16-year old brother is a head taller than me.” He says jokingly. “the shame” he says falling over as if in serious pain. This bastard just because he is taller doesn’t mean I won’t beat him like I used to do when we were kids. Someone’s become ballsy because he grew a few inches. <br><br>
        “Haven’t seen you in years lovely to hear that you still want me to beat you up, Clay I could have sworn I taught you better than that before I left.”<br><br>
        “Oh, really, you think you can actually reach me,” he giggled out not noticing that I had inched closer to him. I swung my leg around behind his knee knocking him down to my level my level.<br><br>
        “I think I can manage.” I say threateningly<br><br>
        “Ding, Ding, Ding, 1 pt. to Zander,” I hear off to the side just realizing that we completely forgot about the giant weirdo. “Man, I thought you said Zander couldn’t take you down with ow big you are now. All talk and no action.” He says<br><br>
        “I thought for sure my height would have deterred him guess I’m have to get him back for this later.” Clay says, “but man you know he could not have beat me if I was expecting it.”<br><br>
        “Sure,” the weirdo and I say at the same time.<br><br>
        <p class="text">
        “Good to see some things haven’t changed in all these years. Zander, your still kicking ass.” He says to me directly. Who is this guy. I don’t remember anyone like him in my past. Noticing my confusion he says, “Oh sorry you probably can’t recognize me how I look now. You used to be so much bigger than me and always Protected me. I’m D’Von, I go by Von now, though. <br><br>
        D’von. Memories flood my mind of all the trouble I used to get in because of him. We were always together when we were in elementary. No one could separate us, we were inseparable as kids until I left, and we lost contact. I sent him letters, but he never responded to any of them. “Yeah, I remember you.” I say not really wanting to talk to someone that obviously didn’t want to talk to me. “So now you know how to respond,” I say spitefully, under my breath.<br><br>
        Von and Clay share a look between each other. Wanting to get away from Von as quickly as possible or maybe tired from the 20 hour flight, I let out a long yawn and question, “Can we go home I am pretty beat after the flight?”<br><br>
        “Sure, let’s go,” Clay says to me. Clay brought a 3-seat truck and I was wedge in between the two of them. Let’s just say that the car ride was quiet, and excruciating long. I was shaken half-awake, not remembering when I went to sleep. I look over to see who woke me up “Hey, can we talk?” he questions in a pleading tone. Whenever he was begging me for something he would put on a face that I just couldn’t say no to, and it seems that, that hasn’t changed. But I’m too tired to deal with it tonight.<br><br>
        “Can we do that tomorrow I just want to go back to sleep?” I whine laying back down on the seat in the car.<br><br>
        “Sure…” Von says as I doze off again. I have a dream of someone lifting me up and being held in someone’s arms. I don’t wake up till the next morning.<br><br>
        I wake up in my old room with a new set of sheets surrounded by all my stuff from when I was a kid. I climb out of the bed and head downstairs where I can smell moms candy bacon wafting out. I let my nose guide me to the kitchen. A woman that I loved stood in the middle of the kitchen taking the crispy bacon out of the oven. “Morning, mom” I say focused more on the bacon than her as my mouth begins to water and my stomach growls.<br><br>
        “Good morning, Zander, we missed you so much while you were gone. You went to bed before you got home and Von carried you to your room you must be starving you slept for an entire day,” my mother says still holding the tray of bacon in her hands.<br><br>
        “Mom I am absolutely starving,” reaching for the tray of bacon she slaps my hand away pulling me into a hug that lasted almost an hour. When she finally releases me, I’m told to set the table for breakfast. I grab the silverware and plates from the kitchen and put them on the table. Every time I went into the kitchen I would try and sneak a piece of bacon but she was always there watching like a hawk. I love her to death but right now my stomach is telling me hungry outranks love.<br><br>
        Mom finally done cooking yells, “Foods ready.” The house quickly begins to awaken as quick footsteps heading in our direction. The first to enter was my brother and my dad was 2 feet behind him. Upon seeing me in the kitchen my dad rushes at me giving me a big bear hug. My dad is only a few inches taller than me making me wonder why my brother so tall. Is Clay a love child I wonder? Thinking about the past mom and dad where always together so when did she have the chance I think looking between dad and Clay. Maybe it was that time when dad was at work. That could be the only chance for her to get some side meat. Nasty brain, stop working, stop, stop. My face must have shown all of what I am thinking because clay takes notice. <br><br>
        “Zander you don’t have to be so obvious,” Clay says laughing at my face “your face shows all of what you are thinking.”<br><br>
        “I don’t know what you are talking about,” I lie through my teeth.<br><br>
        My stomach grumbles notifying all of us that it is time to get some food in our stomachs. Heading to the table I sit down across from clay with mom and dad on either side of me. I grab the tray of bacon just to get my hand swatted away yet again only this time it was by dad. “We have to pray before we eat.” You have got to be kidding me. I haven’t prayed since I left. “Since you grabbed for the food you have to be the one who prays.”<br><br>
        Okay they want to play this I only remember my nursery prayer this ought to be good. “Come lord Jesus, be our guest, let these gifts… Amen” I reach for the food this time and no one stopped me so I dug in. Plate finally full I gobble it all down in only a few bites. Finally looking up when my plate was cleaned to notice everyone staring at me.<br><br>
        The only one stupid enough to say something about it was my brother who jokingly said, “where does all that food go, and how are you not taller with that appetite.”<br><br>
        “you want a repeat of yesterday…” I stop finally remember what mom said about Von caring me upstairs to my room. “VON CARRIED ME,” I yell in complete shock. I thought it was all a dream. OH MY GOSH! Now I must be nice to him, dammit. <br><br>
